This project involves the creation of a simple text editor running in the Windows environment. The goal was to use my recently acquired PySide6 (using the Qt Framework) knowledge alongside Python to create a simple but functional application that can be run in a Windows environment.

The initial graphical interfaces were created in Qt Designer. It was compiled into Python code and imported into the display application. Slots and methods were defined for each action/function, and everything was imported into the core application execution. The icon PNG files were imported into Qt Designer's resource file and then exported with Base64 for use in a Python file.
